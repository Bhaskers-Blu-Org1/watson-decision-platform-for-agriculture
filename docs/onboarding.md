## Client On-boarding - Account, Users, Entitlements, Initial Data Upload

Typically, a Decision Platform sales rep or offering manager would be engaged for client trial/POC or full engagement as per a front-office client engagement process.â€¯In order to work thru this process, please reach out to your IBM sales/offering representative. The process results in the following: 

**A.** The product/support team provisions an account (organization/client level) within Watson Decision Platform and generates identities for user(s) who are representative owners of regions of interest, typically represented as bounded polygons. 

**B.** Creation of user id/passwords for users to access mobile/web applications running with Watson Decision Platform and/or issue API key(s) that a caller can use to access Watson Decision Platforms APIs in a secure manner. There are entitlements associated with the keys that tell the platform who the user is (whether administrator or not) - and allow persisting/retrieving data and execution of authorized analytics while maintaining client-specific isolation. 

**C.** Front-office engagement process also includes a step for on-boarding grower data into the platform at the time of account setup. This is done by creating a client data package that can be uploaded to a secure Box location. Assuming the data package is properly constructed, the product/support team takes care of on-boarding the grower data (at a minimum, field polygons, and optionally, crop type and planting date) within the package against the generated user identities into Watson Decision Platform.
